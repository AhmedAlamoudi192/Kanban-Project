# KanbanProject

A simple KanBan Board Project using angular and firebase to get myself familiar with these technologies

check it out ? here: https://kanban-project-5f5b8.web.app/

it is deployed on Firebase (neat feature XD )

the main lessons from this project were the following 
* no sql databases
* singleton pattern (firebase like types)
* working with typescript and angular
* understanding service injuection
* working with material ui
* using the animation sdk for material ui (pretty powerful stuff)
this was a fun project to build :)
